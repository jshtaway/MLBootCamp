#### Back story:

Using data we scrape from the web, what can we learn about our data via unsupervised
learning techniques?  Extend your analysis by combining unsupervised and supervised learning methods, or by developing a recommender system, etc.


#### Data:

 * **type**: text data
 * **acquisition**: api's, scraping, etc.
 * **storage**: mongodb


#### Skills & Tools

 * flask
 * mongodb
 * nlp
 * unsupervised learning
 * dimensionality reduction
 * topic modeling
 * recommender systems

#### Analysis:

 * unsupervised learning is required, other types of modeling (listed above) are encouraged


#### Deliverable/communication:

 * organized project repository
 * slide presentation
 * visual and oral communication in presentations
 * write-up of process and results


#### Design:

 * iterative design process
 * "MVP"s and building outward
