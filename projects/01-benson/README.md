## Project Benson
###### Week 1

In our first project, we'll get data from a city data portal and do exploratory data analysis to look at patterns in foot traffic in the city. Working in teams, we'll contextualize this exercise using design thinking to create imaginative use cases. Finally, we'll assemble persuasive proposals that communicate our findings and our curiosity using tight verbal and visual communication.

**Due**: Groups will present on **Friday, September 22nd**

#### Back story:

Say that you'd like to do some data work for an organization, but they aren't hiring. They might not even know that they could benefit from the data science services of a skilled practitioner like you. How can you get their attention?

For Project Benson, you're going to send a preliminary analysis and a proposal to your organization to try to get your foot in the door. To do this, you'll use free accessible data about the patterns of transit traffic in the city. Your job is to lay out a case that your skills and insights are useful for their unique needs.

#### Data:

 * **acquisition**: download of data from an open repository
 * **storage**: flat files
 * **sources**: New York City Data Portal


#### Skills:

 * data i/o, ipython notebook (jupyter)
 * data exploration, transformations, plotting
 * communication, proposal writing


#### Analysis:

 * aggregation


#### Deliverable/communication:

 * backstory (description of client, their problem, and your proposed solution)
 * proposal to the client
 * visual and oral communication in proposal
 * team presentation of your work


#### Design:

 * question formation and brainstorming
 * empathic design
 * designing in teams


#### Project Details:

In teams of three or four, you will work together to explore the MTA turnstile data and think about patterns that you can extract from the data to inform your potential client about the movement of people in the city. You want to demonstrate your ability to be resourceful with limited resources, to understand the needs of the organization, and to imagine further work you could do with additional time and/or data.

The [01-data_munging Challenge](../../challenges/challenges_questions/01-mta) will help you get started with your data exploration and get you up to speed with the skills and tools you need to complete this project.

#### Deliverables:

Your team's work will occur in a few stages, each with a deliverable:

1. **Backstory:**  
After familiarizing yourselves with the data, you'll work together to brainstorm what kind of organization you will approach with your proposal. The organization can be real or imaginary, a private company or a social sector group, anything you desire.  
**Due date**: Submit a brief written description of your client/target to the Benson channel in slack by end of day **Tuesday 9/19**.

1. **Check in:**  
Each group should have an informal check-in with the instructors about their progress sometime on **Wednesday 9/20**.

1. **Proposal:**  
Using the MTA data, you'll put together a demonstration of your usefulness to them in the form of a short proposal, using verbal descriptions and illustrative plots and/or sketches from your preliminary analysis. Yes, you must work with the data and have preliminary analyses to talk about in your proposal.  
**Due date**: Submit proposal documents to the GitHub repo by **6:00pm on Friday, 9/22**

1. **Presentation:**  
Your group will present its project to the class as a whole, as a pitch. Presentations will be 8 minutes long. Each team member should speak at least part of the time. If you have slides, please keep them to a minimum.  

#### More info and examples

**Your backstory**

This is a fairly free-form project, and creativity is welcome. Be sure that there is enough time to do good work with the data, but it is fine to tinker with the premise of the project.

For instance, you may decide that an organization has approached *you*, soliciting your help. Here's an example email that a former group "received" from a non-profit: [Example Client Email](./Example_Client_Email.md).

**Your proposal**

Proposals do not have very rigid structures and many differ from each
other. Keep it short: ~ 2 pages is a good rule of thumb. Most clients
won't be super excited by the prospect of reading a 19 page
report. Avoid dry, passive voices. Don't put any code in. You want to
excite them. Keep in mind that they are not data scientists, so keep
the level high and not too technical.

Here are _very general_ guidelines:

You can start with a very brief (2-3 sentences) problem statement,
defining the question you're attacking. Then you can describe what
immediate insights you pulled out of an initial, simple exploration of
the mta data. You can put in a few graphs.

Then you can go into your plans of getting external data and analysis
to help them solve their problem. You can put a sketch or two in
there, or not, up to you. And you're done!
