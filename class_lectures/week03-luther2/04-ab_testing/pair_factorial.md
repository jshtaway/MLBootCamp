#### Pair Problem #1: FACTORIAL

Factorial(n) written as n! is the product of all the numbers up to n.
8! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 = 40320

Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.

		def factorial(n):

Once done, can you rewrite this function using recursion? A recursive function is one that calls itself.

#### Pair Problem #2: FIBONACCI SERIES

Fibonacci series goes like this: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

You start with 0 and 1. Each of the following numbers are the sum of the previous two numbers in the series.

Write a function, that given N, will return the Nth number of the Fibonacci series.

Once done, can you rewrite this function using recursion?
