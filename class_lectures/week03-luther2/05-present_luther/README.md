### Plan for Friday, October 6

#### Overview

Luther day!

#### Schedule

**9:15 am**: Coffee up, squad.

**9:30 am**: Finish Luther!

**12:00 pm**: Must we eat lunch?

**1:30 pm**: Presentation time :smile:

Second project done, third project starting on Monday!

Take this time to wrap up Luther. You won't have time to look back much as we move forward!

Before Monday, you should have:

 * A Luther GitHub repository (with a nice descriptive name, not "luther") with your code and a README with any relevant links, such as links to your presentation deck online and/or your write-up (see next).
 * A write-up of your project work, probably as a blog post. This can have more technical depth and completeness than your presentation. You could also write up short posts about particular aspects of your project. For example, you could write a post about data collection, a post with visualizations, and a post about your regression work.
 * Challenges one, two, three, and four submitted to the class repository. If you don't finish every part, submit what you have! There are new challenges next week!
