# Fork, Clone, Blog, Markdown


### Objectives:

 * Fork and clone repositories on GitHub.
 * Publish blog posts using Markdown.


### Ideas:

 * Git is distributed; every local repository is self-sufficient.
 * GitHub hosts repositories and makes them accessible in a variety of ways, including:
     * forking (copying a GitHub hosted repo to be another GitHub hosted repo)
     * cloning (copying a GitHub hosted repo to be a repo on your computer)
     * serving the repo's contents as a web site (including pre-processing with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/))
 * Markdown is a simple text format for writing web documents.


### Process:

 * Fork the [barryclark/jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) repo to your GitHub account.
 * Go to Settings. Rename your fork to be called `yourgithubusername.github.io`. This is a GitHub convention for making a "user page".
 * Notice you now have a web site at `yourgithubusername.github.io`.
 * Clone your fork to your local machine with `git clone`.
 * Edit the files locally (both configuration and markdown files), commit, and push back up to your fork on GitHub.
    - Edit _config.yml: 
        * Edit username, subject & photo  
    - Edit file in _posts directory (Note: Delete the placeholder content.  Enter your own content & update date)  
 * Break the "fork" relationship on GitHub by deleting the repo on GitHub, creating a new blank repo, and pushing back from your local machine.
