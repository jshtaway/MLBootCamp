### Plan for Monday, Sep 18

#### Overview

## Schedule

[A thought for the day](https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/565516534089785344)

**9:15 am**: Rolling start with breakfast

 * Make sure you have:
     * The [Slack app](https://slack.com/apps) on your laptop and phone
     * Access to this repository
     * [Git](http://git-scm.com/) installed (check `git --version`)
     * Your GitHub account set up
         * Including a picture!
         * Some people like to [keep their email address private](https://help.github.com/articles/keeping-your-email-address-private/), but this is generally not important.
         * [Set up SSH keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/).
         * Setup caching of your Git credentials.
            * For [Linux](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-linux), type `git config --global credential.helper cache`. This is not enabled by default on most distributions.
            * For [Mac](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/#platform-mac), the setting should be enabled by default; however, if you have issues with your password being remembered, execute `git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain`.
      * **Optional**: Setup [RISE](RISE_setup.md).  This is the Jupyter Notebook extension that I will often use for slide presentations in Jupyter notebook.  It is only necessary if you want to see exactly the same style on your screen as I have on mine, so not very necessary.


**9:30 am**: Meet your team!

 * Introduce yourself with:
     * Name
     * Where you're from, and where you're living now
