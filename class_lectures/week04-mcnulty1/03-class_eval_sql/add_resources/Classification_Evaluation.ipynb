    "# Classification Evaluation\n",
    "If you head on over to the [`sklearn.metrics` module](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#classification-metrics) you'll find a whole bunch of them for evaluating **Classification Models** like so:\n",
    "<img src='img/class_metrics.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we're going to unpack **what** these things are, **why** we (might) need so many different ones, and **how** we might use them.  Let's go!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: You'll also see metrics for **Regression** and **Clustering Evaluation** in the `sklearn.metrics` package as well!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Definitions\n",
    "- **Classification Metrics**: metrics for evaluating performance of classification models on a test set.\n",
    "  - **Remember**: Like with Regression, these are what you use to choose the **best** model **for your context**.\n",
    "- **Positive Class**: The class of interest, you specify!  Alternatively, \"Class 1\", if you will.\n",
    "  - This has no meaning in multiclass classification.\n",
    "- **Negative Class**: The remainder not in the positive class (\"Class 0\", often, tho maybe \"Class -1\").\n",
    "  - This has no meaning in multiclass classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Comment on Multiclass vs Multilabel\n",
    "- Some of these metrics work only on ***binary classification***, aka only 2 classes.\n",
    "- Some work on ***multiclass classification***, aka more than 2 classes.\n",
    "- Some also work on ***multilabel classification***, essentially where instances can have **multiple classes**.\n",
    "- You can read more [here](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/multiclass.html).\n",
    "- For now, let's **focus on binary classification**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples of Classification Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Confusion Matrix\n",
    "- The **Confusion Matrix** is a table of the **actual classes** (ground truth) along the rows vs the **predicted classes** (from a model) along the columns\n",
    "- In `sklearn.metrics`: `confusion_matrix`, or `classification_report` (indirectly)\n",
    "- We can **derive most of our further classification metrics with quantities from the confusion matrix**\n",
    "- For binary classification, it looks like this:\n",
    "<img src='img/confusion.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Some comments:  \n",
    "- Whoa!  That's a lot to take in, but it's actually not very complicated. \n",
    "- The only raw values are those in the cells marked **True Positive**, **False Negative**, **False Positive**, and **True Negative**.\n",
    "- The rest of the values are derived from those 4 values.\n",
    "- Here's an example, with those 4 values filled in:\n",
    "<img src='img/confusion2.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Well that certainly feels less complicated.  Now let's step through each of the inner cells in the first table...\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Motivating with an Example\n",
    "- Consider a classifier that predicts from a routine check-up the probability of a patient having a rare disease called Paulitis which, if not caught early leads to a slow, painful death.  \n",
    "<img src='img/paul.jpg' style='height:400px; display:inline-block'/>\n",
    "<img src='img/doc.jpg' style='height:400px; display:inline-block'/>\n",
    "- Paulitis affects only 1% of the general population.\n",
    "- Your training set reflects this: **1% of training examples are positive for Paulitis**.\n",
    "- You run a model on a whole host of patient attributes, and are excited to test it out...\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Question: What could go wrong here?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The Model\n",
    "- You build some sort of **Bayesian classifier** that will only report patients as likely having Paulitis if the model predicts a probability greater than your **chosen threshold of 0.50**.\n",
    "- Well, you **cross-validate your model** like the good data scientist you are and are overjoyed to report that you've **attained 99% accuracy!**\n",
    "- Should you start selling your secret screening process to doctors looking to catch Paulitis before it starts patients on that tortuous path?\n",
    "- Hmm, this seems like a trap...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Re-Examining our Model\n",
    "- You examine your model's predictions and make a startling discovery...\n",
    "- **Your model is predicting no disease for every single patient!**\n",
    "- You'll never catch any instances of that awful Paulitis!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### But how?  We cross-validated!\n",
    "Simply put:\n",
    "***Accuracy is often not the best evaluation metric!!!***\n",
    "- Especially when you have **Imbalanced Classes**\n",
    "- **Imbalanced Classes**: when there is a significantly different number of one class from another in a classification problem.\n",
    "  - Here there are 99 times the amount of negative patients as positive!\n",
    "<img src='img/paulitis.png'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Accuracy Sucks (sometimes)\n",
    "- Don't believe me that accuracy is misleading?  Here, let's examine some of our other metrics:\n",
    "- **TNR aka Specificity**: $TNR = SPC = (TN)/(TN+FP)=100/(100+0) = 1.0$\n",
    "  - Well that looks great to me!\n",
    "- **False Discovery Rate**: $FDR = (FP)/(FP + TP) = 0/(0 + 1) = 0.0$\n",
    "  - Still looking good!\n",
    "- **TPR** aka **Recall**: $\\text{Recall} = (TP)/(TP + FN) = 0/(0 + 1) = 0.0$\n",
    "  - Oh no...oh bad bad bad...\n",
    "  - This means of all the patients out there about to die of Paulitis, we'll save none of them!\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### Question\n",
    "What's worse?\n",
    "- **Option A**: \n",
    "  - You are told after your routine screening that the model suggests you have Paulitis.\n",
    "  - You undergo a whole day of thorough testing to ultimately find out the model was wrong, you don't have it.\n",
    "  - What type of error (Type I/II) is this?\n",
    "- **Option B**:\n",
    "  - The model decides you don't have Paulitis, and you're sent home following your routine check-up.\n",
    "  - It turns out you did have Paulitis, and a short time later you die cold and alone of this awful disease, wishing you'd taken up a career in Data Science.\n",
    "  - What type of error (Type I/II) is this?\n",
    "  \n",
    "##### What should you do?\n",
    "Lower the threshold!  Lower it to the point where you're actually doing some good in the world!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Moral of the Story\n",
    "- **The classification metric you choose matters**.\n",
    "- The classification metric you choose **should be context specific**.\n",
    "  - e.g.: In marketing maybe favor recall over precision.  The cost of sending out a few extra emails is trivial, and you just want to catch as many potential customers as you can.\n",
    "  - e.g.: In Spam detection favor precision.  The cost of missing an important email in the Spam folder is probably far greater than the cost of getting a few extra junk emails."
