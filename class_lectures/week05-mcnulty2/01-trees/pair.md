There is a building with 100 floors. You have two eggs. If either egg is dropped from the Kth floor or above it will break. If it's dropped from any of the floors below, it wouldn't break, however many times you dropped it. We need to find the cut-off floor K. How many tries would you need before you can find that floor?
