#### Pair Question

For each question below, say yes, no or somewhat for these classification algorithms: KNN, Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, SVC, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Naive Bayes.  Keep it brief!  We'll discuss shortly.

    1) Is it interpretable?
    2) Is it inherently multi-class?
    3) Is it scalable with large number of features (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?
    4) Is it scalable with large number of data points (in terms of execution time and quality of results)?
    5) Is it good with diverse (non-homogenous) set of features?
